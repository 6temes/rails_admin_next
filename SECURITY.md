# Security Policy

## Supported versions

`rails_admin_next` targets a single supported runtime: Ruby >= 4.0.5, Rails ~> 8.1,
ActiveRecord, and the importmap + Propshaft asset pipeline. Security fixes land on the
latest `1.x` release.

| Version | Supported                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.x     | yes                                                         |
| < 1.0   | no (the pre-fork `rails_admin` gem; unrelated release line) |

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the
repository's _Security_ tab (private security advisories), not through a public issue or pull
request. Include a description, affected versions, and a reproduction if possible. You will get an
acknowledgement and a remediation timeline.

For the admin's request-forgery, clickjacking, export, destructive-action, mass-assignment, and
Content-Security-Policy posture (and the one host opt-in), see [`docs/security.md`](docs/security.md).

## Automated scanning

CI gates every push and pull request on:

- **bundler-audit** — Ruby gem advisories (`bundle exec bundler-audit check --update`). Reviewed,
  justified ignores live in [`.bundler-audit.yml`](.bundler-audit.yml) (currently a few
  test/development-only advisories that are not in the gem's runtime dependency closure).
- **brakeman** — static analysis (`bundle exec brakeman -A`). Reviewed false positives live in
  [`config/brakeman.ignore`](config/brakeman.ignore), each with a written justification.
- **Dependabot** — weekly `bundler` and `github-actions` update PRs
  ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)).
- **Standard** and **Prettier** — Ruby and JS/CSS style gates.

## Importmap pins: fully self-hosted (jspm blind spot closed)

The engine's importmap ([`config/importmap.rails_admin.rb`](config/importmap.rails_admin.rb)) pins
**only self-hosted assets** — there are no external CDN URLs (`grep jspm.io` returns nothing). Every
third-party module resolves from a file on the Propshaft load path, served and fingerprinted
same-origin:

- `@hotwired/stimulus`, `@hotwired/turbo-rails` → the `stimulus-rails` / `turbo-rails` gems.
- `@rails/actioncable`, `@rails/activestorage`, `@rails/actiontext` → the `actioncable` /
  `activestorage` / `actiontext` gems (all pulled in by the `rails` dependency; `action_cable/engine`
  is `require`d in [`lib/rails_admin_next/engine.rb`](lib/rails_admin_next/engine.rb) so its asset
  path registers).
- `trix` → the `action_text-trix` gem (loaded with ActionText).
- `rails_admin_next/*` → the engine's own source under `src/`, versioned with the gem.

Because every pinned module ships inside a gem, **Dependabot's `bundler` updates move all of them** —
the front-end JS is now versioned in lockstep with the gems. The previous jspm.io blind spot (pins
that no manifest declared and Dependabot could not see) is **closed**; there is nothing left to
hand-audit in the importmap.

### No external front-end network surface

There is **no remaining external CDN or third-party network dependency** in the engine's front-end —
default or opt-in. The previously cdnjs-backed rich-text/code editors (CKEditor, CodeMirror,
SimpleMDE) have been removed; rich text is now served exclusively by the self-hosted ActionText/Trix
pin, and any other text field renders a plain textarea. Every asset the engine serves resolves
same-origin off a gem on the Propshaft load path.

- **Tooling:** the repository's `update-importmap` workflow automates the detect → audit →
  re-vendor/re-pin loop for the self-hosted front-end dependencies.
