## How this fork tracks upstream

RailsAdminNext is a hard fork of [railsadminteam/rails_admin](https://github.com/railsadminteam/rails_admin). It is **never merged or rebased from upstream**, and it cannot be: the fork deleted whole subsystems upstream still ships — the Mongoid adapter, the npm/webpack build, jQuery and `@rails/ujs`, Bootstrap's JavaScript, Appraisal, CarrierWave. Replaying this fork's history onto a moving upstream would conflict with every commit touching any of them, by construction.

Instead, upstream work is absorbed by **reimplementation**: read the upstream commit, judge whether the underlying problem exists here, and write the fix in this codebase's terms. A port therefore need not — and often should not — match upstream's diff. Deliberate divergences are recorded below so they are not "corrected" back later.

This means `git rev-list --count upstream/master...master` is not a progress measure. It counts commits never merged, so it does not fall when work is absorbed and it grows every time upstream moves. **This ledger is the state.** The watermark above records what has been assessed; the table records the verdict for each commit, including the ones deliberately skipped.

## Verdicts

Commits are listed newest first, as `git log` reports them.

## Standing divergences

Where a port deliberately differs from upstream's own patch. Each is correct *for this fork*; changing one to match upstream would reintroduce a bug.

**`Association#inverse_of`** (from `91e9cca8`) resolves the declared `inverse_of:`, then the inverse ActiveRecord resolves for the reflection, then a polymorphic `as:` — and honours `inverse_of: false`. Upstream reads only the declared option and `as`.

- The middle step exists because this fork is ActiveRecord-only. Upstream's adapter also serves Mongoid, which resolves no inverse, so `as` is the only source available to both. Without the middle step, a conventional pair that declares nothing on either side reports no inverse and keeps rendering its back-reference.
- Honouring `inverse_of: false` matters because `false.try(:to_sym)` is `nil`, so upstream's `|| as` silently reinstates an inverse the host explicitly declined.
- The order is load-bearing. Reading the declared option first is what keeps a polymorphic `belongs_to` that declares an inverse from raising inside Rails' reflection, where the class cannot be computed.

**`FormBuilder#nested_field_association?`** (from the same commit) limits its hoisted name-match branch to association fields. Upstream's hoist is unconstrained. A polymorphic `as:` is never validated against the child class, so without the limit a plain column sharing that name can be suppressed from a subform.

**`sanitize_params_for!`** drops the parent's inverse from the nested allowlist, which upstream does not do at all — its permitted keys are derived purely from the visible fields. Hiding the back-reference without narrowing the allowlist left a collection subform re-parentable through a crafted `<assoc>_attributes[n]`, since `assign_nested_attributes_for_collection_association` assigns straight onto an already-associated record ([#24](https://github.com/6temes/rails_admin_next/pull/24)).

**`Field::Base#valid_length` drops Symbol bounds as well as Proc ones** (from `9336ec71`), and drops them only from the three keys that get compared (`LENGTH_BOUNDS`). Upstream drops every Proc-valued entry and no Symbols at all.

- ActiveModel sanctions four bound types and resolves Proc and Symbol against the record at validation time, so neither can be compared against the column limit. Measured here: `minimum: :some_method` raised the same `ArgumentError` upstream's fix addresses for Procs, and a surviving `maximum: :some_method` rendered "Length up to max_len" as help text.
- The narrowing to three keys exists because `valid_length` is a `register_instance_option` that host apps read. Rejecting every Proc, as upstream does, would also strip `if:`/`unless:` conditions from the hash.
- `:in` and `:within` need no entry: ActiveModel collapses them to `:minimum`/`:maximum` at validator construction, and a Proc passed as `:in` raises at declaration time.

**`StatementBuilder#to_statement` excludes `between` from the `_discard` strip** (from `897ffc13`), and strips only when the array actually contained the sentinel. Upstream strips unconditionally.

- `between` reads its value array by index, so removing an element shifts the range ends. Measured: `["ignored", "_discard", "20"]` became a `>= 20` filter where it had been `<= 20`.
- An array that arrived empty is not an array the strip emptied. A date filter legitimately submits `{v: [], o: "today"}`, carrying its meaning in the operator alone; returning early on any empty array breaks it.
- Upstream's client-side half is deliberately not ported. `filter_box_controller` here sets `disabled` on the sentinel options in multi-select mode, not merely `hidden`, and a disabled `<option>` is excluded from form submission — a stronger guarantee than upstream's deselect.

**The engine's stylesheet and style-preload tags carry the CSP nonce** (from `1f681b48`), but `csp_meta_tag` does not ship. Turbo reads that meta to re-nonce scripts it re-activates, and this engine renders no body script for it to re-activate; the nonce generator here is also per-request random, which a cached Turbo snapshot would carry stale. Adding the meta wants that generator decision alongside it.

## Assessing the next batch

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline --first-parent 897ffc13..upstream/master
```

`--first-parent` is load-bearing. Upstream folds whole histories in from time to time — `70ca765e` merged its GitHub wiki into `docs/`, and a plain `git log` across it turns an 18-commit batch into 1301, the extra 1283 being someone else's markdown. Check anything that is a merge (`git log -1 --format='%P %s' <sha>`) for what it actually brought in: vendored docs are one row, a merged feature branch needs its commits triaged individually.

Triage each commit by the **underlying problem**, not by the API, selector, or library its diff happens to touch. State the problem without naming any of them; if that sentence describes something possible here, the commit is relevant even when its diff is entirely in code this fork deleted.

`77e5d0bc` above is the cautionary case, and it cuts both ways. It was first dismissed as jQuery-UI-only, which was the wrong reason — the race it describes is stated in terms of a selector, and dismissing it on that vocabulary is exactly the mistake the rule above exists to prevent. But the CI failure that seemed to confirm the re-triage turned out to be an unrelated bug: an example reading the database before the server had answered ([#23](https://github.com/6temes/rails_admin_next/pull/23)). The widget itself stamps and aborts its requests, and instrumenting it showed one render per query, so the upstream race has no counterpart here.

**A coincident failure is not confirmation.** Look past a commit's vocabulary to decide whether it *could* apply, then measure this fork's own code before concluding that it does.
